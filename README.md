### **What External User Must Have Do**

## Signup

## External User Signup & Verification Process

This system uses a **multi-step signup process** to ensure user authenticity by integrating with the National ID (Fayda) system.

---

### **Step 1: Enter National ID Number (FAN)**

- The user starts the signup process by entering their **Fayda Alias Number (FAN)** (National ID number).
- The system sends a request to the **nationalidapi** microservice to fetch personal information.
- If the FAN is valid, the following details are displayed (read-only):
  - First Name
  - Middle Name
  - Last Name
  - Gender

---

### **Step 2: Phone Number Confirmation**

- The user is prompted to enter their **phone number**.
- The system checks if the entered phone number matches the one registered with the National ID (Fayda) information.
- If the phone number matches, the user proceeds to the next step.
- If not, an error message is shown and the user must try again.

## Security

- **Helmet.js**: Sets HTTP headers for security.
- **CORS**: Only allows requests from whitelisted origins.
- **JWT**: Used for authentication and authorization.
- **express-rate-limit**: Protects against brute-force attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Global: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP.
  - Admin Login: 5 attempts per minute per IP. After 5 failed attempts, login is locked for 1 minute.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS errors:** Ensure backend CORS middleware is at the top and origins are correct.
- **MongoDB connection issues:** Check your `MONGO_URI` in `.env`.
- **Rate limit lockout:** Wait for 1 minute after 5 failed login attempts.
- **Socket.IO issues:** Make sure the frontend and backend use the same allowed origins and credentials.
